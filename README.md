Using SVM for IRIS dataset and GridSearchCV

Support Vector Machines Project
Welcome to your Support Vector Machine Project! Just follow along with the notebook and instructions below. We will be analyzing the famous iris data set!

The Data For this series of lectures, we will be using the famous Iris flower data set.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
